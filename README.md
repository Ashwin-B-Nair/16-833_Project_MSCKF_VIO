# 16-833_Project_MSCKF_VIO

This project is based on the MSCKF implementation by [rohiitb](https://github.com/rohiitb/msckf_vio_python),which in itself is translated from the official C++ implementation [KumarRobotics/msckf_vio](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/msckf_vio),  with the following modifications:
- Changed visualizer
- Improved outlier detection methods (RANSAC)
- Improved feature pruning
- Analysis of changes on pose estimation accuracy

  
This work was completed as part of 16-833 Robot Localization and Mapping at Carnegie Mellon University.
